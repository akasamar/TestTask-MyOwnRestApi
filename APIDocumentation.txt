SHORT MANUAL FOR MY REST API 


*I wanna that you pay attention to http methods when you send request to the server.
*All requests you can send in json form and get back result in same. Use POSTMAN.
*Strictly follow the rules which I wrote bellow, don't try write more or less parameters of requests
if it doesn't need one. Otherwise you will get error :(


POST /signup - Registration
GET /signin - Autorization

GET    /tasks - Get Task list
POST   /tasks - Create task list
PUT    /tasks - Make mark as done for given task
DELETE /tasks - Delete given task by id





1)At first you have to make registration. You need to input 2 parameters.

/signup
- email
- password

For example:
{
	"email": "123@i.ua",
	"password": "12345"
}

You will get two tokens - access and refresh, their work too close to real api \.
If the time one of tokens will expire that refresh both and you will need to reauthorize.
If you autorize tokens will change themselves automatically to maintain safety.

2)For autorization and get tokens use the same form above 

/signin
- email
- password

3) For creating new task use your token from registration or autorization form

/tasks
- token
- title (any)
- priority (only - low, normal, high)

4) Get a list of your or someone tasks using

/tasks
- email

 or

 /tasks
- email
- sort_option (only - priority, title, date, mark)
- order_by (only - asc, desc)

For example:
{
	"email": "1234@i.ua",
	"sort_option": "date",
	"order_by": "asc"
}

5) Your tasks which have a status as 'mark is done' you can get in your task list. For changing one use:

/tasks
- token
- mark_task_id

6) And the last one. If you wanna delete some of your tasks just use 

- token
- delete_task_id
